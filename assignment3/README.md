# Baseball Eliminaton Program (Java)
The assignment is to implement an algorithm to determine which teams in a sports league division have been eliminated from the playoffs. A Java template has been provided containing an empty method BaseballElimination, which takes a single argument consisting of a Scanner object which connects you to the input consisting of the data related to a division of teams within a sports league. The expected behavior of the method is as follows: 

#### Input: **A baseball division consisting of ùëõ teams.** 
#### Output: **An ArrayList consisting of all the teams that have been eliminated from the 	  league playoffs**. 

We will assume that the team with the most wins in the division at the end of the season is the only team to make the playoffs. So, a team is eliminated from the playoffs if they cannot possibly win as many games as some other team in the division.

This program uses `FordFulkerson.java`, `FlowNetwork.java`, and `FlowEdge.java` classes from the Algorithms (Sedgewick) textbook through the agls4.jar file.
